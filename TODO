* for better multiconn state handling - dont use bluez-compassion
   rfcomm.py - code a similar class to handle the connections and get
   the fd directly from bluez instead of going through the limitations
   of one-way pipes etc.

* use dicts/lists/queus from multiprocessing -

   https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#sharing-state-between-processes
   to maintain open fds
   

* test after broken pipe or resoruce not avail (From dev disconnect
   for many mins) then reconnect would fail until only hci0 down and
up again
  * try not use pipes - try rabbitmq or redis instead or mp call
directly
  * if bt_write: i 0 exception [Errno 11] Resource temporarily
   unavailable and no devices connected try hci0 down and up every 60
secs
  * fifo creator do fcntl.fcntl(fd, F_SETPIPE_SZ, ) limit 512 only

* cleanup code

* test multi devices


* handle bt usb removed during connect - must be able to handle
* handle gps usb removed

* make autostart and test from opi
