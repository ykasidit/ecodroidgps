* unix domain sockets can get hang if one reader blocks - tested using
/dev/urandom and multi readers and one blocker
  * use the c code - popen read from the chardev - if disconnected
   then reopen then re read - readline until buffer full or timelapse
= N millis
  * then save to global buff with id - if reader already sent that id
   so dont resend

* handle bt usb removed during connect - must be able to handle

* make autostart and test from opi
