* read and broadcast like:

https://serverfault.com/questions/747980/simpliest-unix-non-blocking-broadcast-socket

Found solution at similar answer https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/195880/socat-duplicate-stdin-to-each-connected-client. Socat seems can't work that way but ncat from nmap package does.

It works same for unix socket:

% mkfifo /tmp/messages-in
% exec 8<>/tmp/messages-in  # hold the fifo open
% ncat -l -U /tmp/messages-out -k --send-only < /tmp/messages-in

% echo "test" > /tmp/messages-in

% # every client connected to /tmp/messages-out will get "test"
message

---

sudo cat /dev/ttyACM0 > /tmp/messages-in
nc -U /tmp/messages-out | sudo python rfcomm.py -p "/my_serial_port" -n "Serial Port" -s -C 1 -u "0x1101"
