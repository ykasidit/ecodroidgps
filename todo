* bash nmea to mqtt_pub service - if py cpu still too high and saw case mqtt pub fail
 -- or use old system cpu still can work

- cpu optimize less debug prints
- save nmea, stdout stderr, parsed gps location to log - or to sqlite?
  - last_notime.*.gz
  - <datetime>.*.gz
  - ex: <datetime>_nmea.txt.gz
  - ex: <datetime>_syslog.txt.gz
  - ex: <datetime>_location.kml.gz

- restore /config for connected bt device list - copy to /config/edg.lic to /tmp before format, copy it back after format
- see ansible all steps pass
- test android normaly mode
- readonly
- set class check btmgmt info same as our target in /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
- pairing: clear /conf/bluetooth test bluetooth pair stays, reboot make sure it stays see bluetoothctl or try connect
- test android normal mode multiconn
- test ble mode
- file method to enable disable serial mode, ble mode
- set gatt device name

- reduce debug print level

- test well


- license flask service read gsheets

python test_parse_gps.py
- rm debug prints
- mqtt pub through api?
- test on real dev

* log all nmea to .txt.gz - if param provided
