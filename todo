EcoDroidGPS - Bluetooth GPS/GNSS Receiver Kits for Android Phones and Tablets
=============================================================================

The GPS Location received by Smartphones/Tablets internal tiny A-GPS Hardware tend to swing, jump or even fail to get a GPS Fix during cloudy/rainy or tinted car windows blocking the sky view - mostly not accurate enough for professional maps, plotting and data collection/survey use.

One solution is to use higher-precision 'USB GPS/GNSS receivers' that were normally plugged into older PC-based map/spatial data collection software but plugging them to Smartphones via OTG connectors is quite tricky and even so would quickly drain and finish the battery from phones during longer data logging/surveys as you can't charge the phone at the same time as using the USB-OTG.

Bluetooth GPS Receivers are better in that they don't use power from the phone so you can even charge the phone while getting GPS via Bluetooth allowing for longer surveys but most models can handle only 1 connected phone at a time (just like a USB GPS), but there are cases where many phones/users would need to use the Bluetooth GPS at the same time - especially mobile network operator benchmark tests where you need a phone for each operator going in the same van and having the same GPS location in the logged data.

Also, most Bluetooth GPS's "receiver chip" is integrated so you cant change or unplug them to try other newer USB GPS receiver chips or take configuring different GPS/GLONASS/Galileo/BeiDou settings via U-Blox U-Center like a USB GPS.

The EcoDroidGPS Blutooth GPS kits attempts to solve these points by being a 'USB to Bluetooth' bridge, providing high-precision positioning from U-Blox based USB GPS/GNSS receivers to multiple connected Android phones at the same time (we've tested up to six!). Users can try connecting other USB GPS devices and even re-configure the provided USB-GPS device by with U-Blox U-Center software on PC.

EcoDroidGPS works with Bluetooth GPS apps like '[Bluetooth GPS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=googoo.android.btgps&hl=en)', '[GNSS Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.pilablu.gnsscommander)' and '[SW Maps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.softwel.swmaps)'. These apps implement 'Mock location providers' in Android and can therefore this precise location to map apps like 'Google Maps' or GPS logger apps.

Features:
  - Galileo satellite support.
  - Connect provided USB GPS Enables U-Blox U-Center to connect over Bluetooth.
  - Implements Bluetooth Low Energy 'Location and Navigation Porofile' (0x1819) which works with iPhone App: '[LE GPS Rec](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/le-gps-rec/id914354624)' and [its open-source SDK](https://github.com/RomainQuidet/LELocation-framework-iOS) (for software developers). This feature is disabled by default to reduce radio resource usage but can be turned on by deleting the file named 'no_ble' in the 'config' partition of the EcoDroidGPS system sdcard (ext4 filesystem).

- edg rpizerow:
  - test u-center
  - test rtk, ppp, ssr fix u-center
     - test f9 with ntrip rtk base bangkok
     - test f9 with igs base     
  - ask ssr in ardusimple forum

  - /data gets formatted too easily - try dont unmount if already mounted, fsck force first
  - manual install samba
  - ftp
  - samba, sees ip
  * save img

save img:
  - re-enable overlay fs - reboot
    - test spp from android
    - socat - tcp:<ip>8888
    - run overnight
    - test again
    - use in car
  - up image to google drive - anyone with the link - adeeb flash

  - license system logs req dev to csv, checks from google sheets
  - video compare s9 vs m8030 vs f9

  - test hc-05 solution + 38400, powerbank
  - test ucenter 3d fix, dual freq, galileo
    - make screenshots videos

  - test edg rpizerow solution + 38400, powerbank
    - multi device nmea
    - ble iphone

  - edg how better?
    - multi device nmea
    - multi device ble iphone
    - gpx, spatialite, can mark pos, win10 can open directly

  - usb rpizerow can stream to android
    - note accuracy, make video youtube share alian
  - research ppp or ssr as mentioned in ardusimple web
  - research rtk send stream from android app via bt to pi, pi sends to f9, f9 sends accurate nmea
  - 'Bluetooth GNSS' app
    - supports rx main feature for bt serial works with holux and legacy bt
    - supports rx ble location and navigation profile bt gps 0x1819
    - supports tx ssr, ppp tx to f9 via bt serial, ble uart
    - supports tx ntrip tx via bt serial, ble uart
  

- log GPX data to /data/<date_time>.gpx
  - auto delete oldest until at least 100 MB space left

- now turn off lic service after done
- license flask service read gsheets
